# Streaming Data Lakehouse
The goal of this project is to provide a learning playground for building a data lakehouse based on batch and streaming workloads.  This project will use Spark, Hadoop, and Delta Tables so that it can be run inside of a home lab, and this project as-is is not suitable for any sort of production environment.  The goal of this project is to teach you how to build your own lakehouse, not to deploy this lakehouse.

## Features
The following is a list of planned features in this project:
* Ingest both batch and streaming data sets
* Utilize a bronze, silver, and gold layer (medallion) architecture
* Perform metadata driven ELT via configuration files
* Utilize publicly availably datasets for source in flat file (CSV), JSON, and MySQL database formats
* Deliver as close to real time as possible
